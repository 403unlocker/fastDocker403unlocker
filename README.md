## About fastDocker403unlocker

I had so many challenges in choosing the docker registry mirror that has the docker image that I wanted and has acceptable download speed that fits with my internet service provider so I developed an script that checks and tests the speed of the docker registry mirrors so I won't waste my time on finding the best docker registry mirror.
