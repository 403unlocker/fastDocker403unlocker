# Fast Docker 403 Unlocker

I had so many challenges in choosing the docker registry mirror that has the docker image that I wanted and has acceptable download speed that fits with my internet service provider so I developed an script that checks and tests the speed of the docker registry mirrors so I won't waste my time on finding the best docker registry mirror.

## Prerequisites

At first you need to install requirements packages for **Debian** base distribution

``` bash
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt install skopeo
```

## How-To

to download the script you can use the following command

```bash
wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArmanTaheriGhaleTaki/fastdocker403unlocker/main/bash.sh
```

after that you need to give the image name and tag as an argument with this format **[image]:tag**
to run the script to analyzing this image at docker mirror registries that are available in [.env](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArmanTaheriGhaleTaki/fastDocker403unlocker/main/.env) file
you can use  the script like this
